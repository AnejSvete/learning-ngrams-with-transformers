# Can Transformer Language Models Learn $n$-gram Language Models?

## Getting started with the code
Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rycolab/learning-ngrams
$ cd learning-ngrams
```
It may be beneficial to create a new Python virtual environment (e.g., using conda). 
We aim at Python 3.10 version and above.

Then install the package (in the required package) in editable mode:
```bash
$ pip install -e .
```
We use pytest to unit test the code.
